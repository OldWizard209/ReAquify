## The prompt:
Using an *__existing technology that has come out in the last 3-5 years__*: create a solution that solves a problem or creates an interesting future.

## Brainstorming:
- Brainstorm ideas for possible, emerging technologies that could be used to create an impactful solution to the world.
- Eliminate least promising ones, and decide between top three picks

## Solution: Microwave Based Water Decontamination
The solution our team came up with is a microwave based water decontamination to eradicate water bacteria, particularly in remote areas, or in places where water is untreated or polluted.
This is a technology developed by [NASA Scientists aboard the ISS](https://technology.nasa.gov/patent/MSC-TOPS-53).

### Problem Statement:
- Bacterial contamination of water systems is a major issue because biofilms can clog or interfere with water system functions and _bacterial ingestion can be harmful to human health_. 
- Globally, at least __2 billion people__ use a drinking water source __contaminated with faeces__. __Microbial contamination__ of drinking-water as a result of contamination with faeces poses the greatest risk to drinking-water safety.
- Contaminated water and poor sanitation are linked to transmission of diseases such as *__cholera, diarrhoea, dysentery, hepatitis A, typhoid and polio__*.

### Mechanics of the device:
- A system for decontaminating a medium. The system can include a medium having one or more contaminants disposed therein. The contaminants can be or include bacteria, fungi, parasites, viruses, and combinations thereof. 
- A microwave energy radiation device can be positioned proximate the medium. The microwave energy radiation device can be adapted to generate a signal having a frequency from about 10 GHz to about 100 GHz. The signal can be adapted to kill one or more of the contaminants disposed within the medium while increasing a temperature of the medium by less than about 10° C.
- Another potential application of microwaves could be the preparation of safe drinking water. When modified carbon nanotubes with 1-octadecanol groups (C18) were combined with microwave irradiation, a removal of E. coli bacteria in water of up to 100% was achieved in contrast to a low removal rate of 3–5% for nanotubes alone (Al-Hakami et al., 2013)
- This decontamination system is chemical free and requires minimal to no consumables. 
- Initial testing identified a specific microwave frequency band and exposure times for killing bacteria (Burkholderia cepacia) and biofilm.
- Contaminated water and poor sanitation are linked to transmission of diseases such as cholera, diarrhoea, dysentery, hepatitis A, typhoid and polio.

### Modifications to the original designs:
As the original design @ISS used an electrical current to convert the power into microwave signals, it would be extremely difficult to enable this in rural, underdeveloped parts of the world where electricity is a huge issue.
To tackle this, we integrated a solar panel charged batery p![Uploading Screen Shot 2022-11-06 at 11.15.50 PM.png…]()
ack in the device that makes use of teh solar cells to power it during the day, and also simultaneously charge itself for use during the night.
